**Mission**

The mission was to provide a website that meets accessibility standards through the       implementation of semantic HTML elements, elements following logical structure, accessible alt attributes, heading attributes in sequential order, and a title element that is concise and descriptive. 

**HTML**

- Modified the html to have accessible alt tags
- Modified the html to show name and page in a clear fashion


**CSS**

- condensed repeated elements in css such as classes and elements which could be condensed into short script
- modified semantic attributes for easier identification
